# License_Plate_Detection
## Project Description

This system detects vehicle license plates from images using deep learning models like YOLOv8 or custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It preprocesses input images applies object detection to localize the plate, and optionally uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to read the license plate number.

The project is designed for use in:
- Traffic monitoring systems
- Smart surveillance for security
- Toll collection systems
- Vehicle tracking in parking management
